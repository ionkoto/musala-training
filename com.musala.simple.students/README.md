Small training project in Java


This is a very simple java program for adding, storing and retrieving students from a database. The program takes as input a windows path to a .json file.
The file is expected to contain a valid JSON string with information about students. The program reads the json file and casts the data to a custom java class called StudentGroup. It outputs the information read from the file and saves it in another (local) json file as a sort of local database.
